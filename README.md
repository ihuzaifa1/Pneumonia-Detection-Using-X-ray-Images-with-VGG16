# Pneumonia Detection Using X-ray Images with VGG16  

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model designed to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model leverages **VGG16**, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, to achieve high accuracy in classifying X-ray images as pneumonia-positive or normal.  

## Overview  

Pneumonia is a critical lung infection that can be diagnosed through chest X-rays. This project applies transfer learning with VGG16 to automate the detection process, aiming to assist radiologists and healthcare providers.  

### Features  

- Pre-trained VGG16 architecture for feature extraction.  
- Binary classification of X-ray images: Pneumonia vs. Normal.  
- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation for improved model performance.  
- Visualization of model predictions and evaluation metrics.

## Dataset  

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled X-ray images of pneumonia-positive and normal cases. It includes images from reputable sources such as the [Kaggle Pneumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).  

**Dataset Structure:**  
- `train/`: Training images  
- `val/`: Validation images  
- `test/`: Testing images

## Model  

The model is built using the VGG16 architecture, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Key modifications include:  
- Replacement of the final fully connected layers to adapt to binary classification.  
- Fine-tuning the last few layers of VGG16 for better performance on X-ray images.  

### Key Libraries Used  
- TensorFlow/Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib
